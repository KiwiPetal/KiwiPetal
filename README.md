## Howdy there! 
I'm a strong believer in Open Source and working on Closed Source stuff makes me want to scream.

Motivated by learning new things, especially if those things are extremely unnecessary. Basically I'm a big [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) enjoyer.

## Random facts
I do pretty much anything there is to code (for the exception of gaming). Somehow didn't get to that niche. Maybe some day though.

But as much as I hate Closed Source, most of the projects I made are, so I kinda don't have much to show for myself. But also **"Maybe some day though"** again.

I'm also a gamer, a 3D artist and used to play music for half of my life. So in case you're interested in my ramblings, feel free to connect with me! :D
